# MyLoRA Desktop Client

This folder contains a Tkinter based client for interacting with the MyLoRA REST API.
The application now uses a dark themed grid interface similar to the MyLora web
gallery.

## Usage

1. Install the requirements:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

Set the `MYLORA_API_URL` environment variable to point to a different server. The default is `http://localhost:5000`.
